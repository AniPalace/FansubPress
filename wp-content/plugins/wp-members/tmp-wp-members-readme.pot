msgid "WP-Members&trade; is a membership plugin for WordPress&reg;.  Perfect for newsletters, premium content sites, and more!  The plugin restricts selected WordPress&reg; content to registered site members.  WP-Members&trade; puts the registration process on the site front end so it is inline with your content (and thus your branded theme) instead of the native WP login page.  WP-Members&trade; works with no modifications to your theme, but it is scalable for users that want to customize the look and feel, or want to restrict only some content.  It is a great tool for sites offering premium content to subscribers, and is adaptable to a variety of applications."

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "By default, WordPress&reg; allows all content to be \"open\" and viewable by anyone and allows the site owner to restrict specific content if desired by setting a password for the post.  WP-Members&trade; operates with the reverse assumption.  It restricts all posts by default but allows the site owner to \"unblock\" content as desired.  WP-Members&trade; also offers the ability to change the default plugin settings.  For those that simply want to utilize the member management features and possibly restrict some content, the default setting can easily be toggled to block or unblock pages and/or posts by default.  No matter what the default setting, individual posts or pages can be set to be blocked or unblocked at the article level, overriding the default setting."
msgstr ""

#. Found in description paragraph.
msgid "The plugin installs with additional registration fields including name, address, phone, and email. Using the WP-Members&trade; admin panel, you can also create your own custom registration fields and delete existing ones.  Changing the field order is simple with a drag-and-drop interface.  All of the registration process is inline with your theme and content rather than using the WordPress&reg; login page.  This offers you a premium content site with a professional and branded look and feel.  It also provides an opportunity for the user to register without leaving the page to do so - less clicks = more conversions."
